# clients

A Clojure library designed to provide common functionality for talking to services.

## Usage

For Leiningen, add the following dependency to a projects.clj file:

```
[quoll/clients "0.1.2"]
```

Use one of the `retry*` macros to execute a block of code repetitively, until it fails
or the retry plan is exhausted.
